# No-Hope

The mod is based on the old lore where there was a full-scale war with China with many months of preceding marauding and civil disorder. Thus the world with the mod will be much more damaged overall, there will be much less loot etc.

Mod has two major goals. The first and the most important one is to make Cataclysm harder and harsher. To achieve this goal, I decreased loot spawn, made most houses spawn damaged, as well as most cars, and some other changes.

The second goal is to return back the original lore and content to the game. To achieve this goal, I returned many removed content, returned old descriptions to monsters, items etc, returned old snippets, and some other changes.

Despite I’m standing for realism side in “realism vs. gamism” debate in vanilla, in this mod I’m changing my priority for balance and gameplay. If realism is standing in the way of FUN, I’m throwing the realism out.

# List of features
- Returned most of the cut “sillynonsense” and other inappropriate (for vanilla) content, including, but not limited to: Rivtech and Leadworks guns, flaming melee weapons, tainted tornado and sewer brew, Fusion Blaster CBM, makeshift scrap firearms, underbarrel flamethrower, atomic cars, laser turret (rewrote description to mention it’s working not on the solar panels, but rather on compact yet powerful storage batteries; updated drop list to reflect that), chickenbot, tankbot and tripod and made it spawn in some military locations, bone armor (for vehicles and player).

- Integrated “Cars to Wrecks” mod. Also manually checked most of the cars spawn in mapgen and set them to spawn at least slightly damaged. Intact cars now are much, much harder to find, though not impossible.

- Radically decreased amount of ammo drop from turrets: 5.56 - 120, 7.62 - 100, .50 - 90.

- Returned old names and descriptions for turrets (they are manufactured by General Atomics and Leadworks), security-bot (Northrop), power armor (DoubleTech).

- Radically nerfed the ESAPI vest - no more “better-than-power-armor” stats. Also significantly decreased chance to spawn it on zombie soldiers (from 90% to 30%).

- Made ordinary walls hard to set on fire. Based on my old closed PR (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/15537). Now you can’t set it on fire using a simple lighter.

- Updated domestic mapgen pallette so now any window in most houses will spawn shattered with 70% chance or fully smashed to frame (20% chance). Intact windows will spawn only with remaining 10% chance. The same for wooden doors: 60% chance to spawn open (imagine it was pryed open), 20% chance to spawn closed but damaged, 10% chance to spawn smashed to frame. Intact doors will spawn only with remaining 10% chance.

- Removed most of the guaranteed loot spawn in every location in the game. I tried to merge these changes into vanilla (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/44581 5), and in the end I’d say it wasn’t successful. But in my mod the chances to spawn guaranteed loot was dropped to 50-80%.

- Returned moose’s legendary aggression. Now it’s the good old machine of destruction as it used to be.

- Integrated “Mutant NPCs” mod. I like the idea, it’s fun, so why not?

- Returned back flaming eye’s ray of destruction (see below in comments for more info). Removed flaming eye’s STARE attack. Added almost identical monster - staring eye with STARE attack.

- Made hiding additional options when examining workbench-type furniture on by default.
